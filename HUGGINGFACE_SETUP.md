   ```bash
   ./start_backend.sh
   ```

   ```bash
   ./start_frontend.sh
   ```

3. Upload a resume and try optimizing it for a job

## Available Models

The app uses `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2` by default. You can change the model in `.env`:

### Recommended Models

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2` | Default, excellent balance | General use ‚≠ê |
| `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf` | Meta's Llama 2 | Conversational tasks |
| `HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta` | Fast and efficient | Quick responses |
| `mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1` | Most powerful | Best quality (slower) |
| `tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct` | Good alternative | Varied tasks |

To change the model, edit `.env`:
```env
HUGGINGFACE_MODEL="meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf"
```

## Free Tier Limits

Hugging Face's free tier includes:

- ‚úÖ **Thousands of requests per month**
- ‚úÖ **Access to all public models**
- ‚úÖ **No credit card required**
- ‚è±Ô∏è Some cold start delays (model loading time)
- ‚è±Ô∏è Rate limiting during high traffic

### If You Hit Rate Limits

If you see rate limit errors:
1. Wait a few seconds between requests
2. Consider upgrading to Hugging Face PRO ($9/month) for:
   - Faster inference (no cold starts)
   - Higher rate limits
   - Priority access

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API token"
- Make sure you copied the entire token (starts with `hf_`)
- Check for extra spaces in the `.env` file
- Regenerate the token if needed

### "Model is loading"
- First request may take 20-30 seconds (cold start)
- Subsequent requests will be faster
- This is normal for the free tier

### "Rate limit exceeded"
- Wait a few seconds between requests
- The free tier resets limits periodically
- Consider PRO tier for heavy usage

### "Model not found"
- Check the model name spelling in `.env`
- Some models may require special access
- Stick with the recommended models above

## Alternative: Use Without API Key

The app will work without an API key, but with limited features:
- ‚ùå No AI-powered optimization
- ‚úÖ Basic keyword matching still works
- ‚úÖ Resume parsing works
- ‚úÖ Job tracking works
- ‚úÖ Manual resume editing works

## Comparing to OpenAI
